            What happens when you try to sell a house with an overgrown garden, cracks in the driveway, and a broken front door? 
            No offers, right? That’s exactly why you need the best homepage design for your website. <br>
            Think of your homepage as analogous to a home’s curb appeal. It’s the first thing many people
             see when they visit your website, so you want to wow them from the second the page loads. <br>
             But it’s not just about aesthetics. You also want your homepage to convert. As I said above, 
             a broken front door and an inaccessible driveway prevents future buyers from even considering 
             the sale. The same goes for your website. <br>
             People can’t or won’t convert if you don’t give them an incentive to do so and if you don’t 
             make converting as easy and intuitive as possible. <br>
             The first step in winning over more customers is to understand the essential elements 
             that should go into every homepage. <br>
             Once you’ve mastered the basics, draw inspiration from 31 top homepage designs so you can 
             find out what will work best for your business and your audience.

        <h1>
            The Benefits of a Well-Designed Homepage
        </h1>
        <p>
            A simple homepage design welcomes your audience to your site, tells 
            them what you want them to do next, and allows them to explore your site in more depth. <br>
            You can add complexity to a simple homepage design, but you don’t want to start with 
            a cluttered mess and have to selectively prune it. Always begin with the basics. <br>
            What do you need on your homepage? What will your audience expect? And which elements take priority?<br>
            When you can answer those questions, you’ll have the information you need for better homepage design. 
            In web design, homepage elements have very specific purposes
        </p>
        <h3>
            Helping your target audience get to know your business
        </h3>
        <p>
            Many of your website visitors will find your homepage first. 
            With that in mind, you need to make a solid first impression. <br>
            Your homepage should provide a sense of your company’s values, unique 
            selling proposition (USP), and purpose. You’re more likely to lure in potential customers 
            if you can effectively communicate this information.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Improving the user experience on your website
        </h3>
        <p>
            Consumers visit your website with a purpose. It could be 
            to check out your product line, read your blog posts, or find out if you 
            sell a particular type of service. <br>
            Regardless, you want to direct that consumer to the appropriate page. Your
             homepage design should facilitate this transition by providing intuitive navigation 
             and a sense of how your website flows.
        </p>
        <h3>Accruing more conversions</h3>
        <p>
            You want website visitors to convert, but they won’t if you don’t give them the necessary 
            incentive and opportunity. Maybe you want to build an email list, but if visitors can’t find a 
            signup form, your database will remain empty. <br>
            By making this information easily accessible on your homepage, you will see an uptick in conversions. <br>
            Another way to boost conversions is to create a strong first impression with your homepage. If visitors 
            enjoy their experience on your website, they’ll also be more likely to remember it in the future. Maybe you 
            won’t make a sale today, but that customer will return days or weeks later and buy from you.
        </p>
        <h3>Improving brand awareness</h3>
        <p>
            Make your company memorable by allowing your brand image and messaging to come through on every page. 
            This is especially true when it comes to your homepage design because the homepage serves as the gateway 
            to the rest of your website. <br>
            Your logo, tagline, and purpose need to take center stage. In fact, you might even want to add a form or statement 
            to the very top of your homepage — preferably in a large font — that gives your visitors a sense of what you do: <br>
            What problems do you solve for your customers? How do you improve your clients’ lives — whether personal or professional? <br>
            Don’t force your website audience to have to figure out and guess what it is you do. Make it clear from the get go.
        </p>
        <h3>How to Design a Website Homepage</h3>
        <p>Now that you know the four goals to motivate your design principles, ask yourself three guiding questions: What do you absolutely 
            need on your homepage? Who is your target audience and what will they expect? Which elements take priority?<br>
            Once you have the answers to these three questions, you can begin plotting out how best to improve your homepage. Remember to tie each 
            of your design elements to one of the four goals listed above. Most importantly, don’t worry about getting it perfect. Website optimization 
            is an ongoing process!

        <h1>The Best Homepage Design Examples (And Why They Work)</h1>
        <p>There’s no better teacher than an example. I’m going to show you some of the best homepage design examples that I’ve found, 
            and I’ll tell you exactly why they work so you can apply those same tactics on your own site.
        </p>
        <h2>1. Dropbox</h2>
        <img src="best-homepage-30.png" alt="">
        <p>
            I’ve called out Dropbox before as an excellent example of good marketing all around. The company’s homepage is no different. 
            You have a slightly askew hero image that draws the eye and two CTAs — one of which uses a dark background to draw more attention since 
            it’s for the paid version of the tool. <br>
            The marketing copy is very simple here. Dropbox knows its target audience and drills down on pain points that affect them, including efficiency 
            and security. Plus, the navigation is pretty stripped down, with an option to “Compare plans.”
        </p>
        <h2>2. Slack</h2>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <p>
            I love the Slack homepage design because of its unique illustrations. You can’t go wrong with custom graphics. I also like the tagline — 
            “Where Work Happens” — because it’s creative, but it also encapsulates the tool’s purpose. <br>
            Slack makes it clear what visitors should do. They can sign in or create an account. Here, we have more navigation options than Dropbox provides, but each 
            contributes to helping visitors find what they want.
        </p>
        <h2>3. Green Mountain Energy</h2>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <p>
            I’m going with another example of custom graphics. Green Mountain Energy leaves no doubt about the company’s purpose. It wants to provide clean 
            energy at an affordable price. There are two equal CTAs — one for residential customers and one for business owners — that use contrasting colors to draw the eye.
        </p>
